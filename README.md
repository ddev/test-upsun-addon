# Upsun Add-on Test Project

This project serves as an authoritative source of working Upsun configurations for testing the [ddev-upsun add-on](https://github.com/rfay/ddev-upsun).

## Purpose

- Provide verified, working Upsun configuration examples
- Support automated testing of the ddev-upsun add-on
- Demonstrate proper Upsun deployment patterns for various project types

## Project Structure

- **Main branch**: Plain HTML/Markdown content (this README)
- **Additional branches**: Will contain specific framework configurations (Drupal, Laravel, etc.)

## Branches

- `main`: Basic HTML/Markdown deployment
- *(Future branches will be added for specific frameworks)*

## Usage

Each branch in this repository represents a different project configuration that can be deployed to Upsun and used for testing the ddev-upsun add-on functionality.

The production environment for the main branch serves this README as a simple HTML page, validating basic Upsun deployment capabilities.
